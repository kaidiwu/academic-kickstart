I am a Ph.D. candidate in social psychology working with David Dunning at the University of Michigan. Prior to graduate school, I received my B.A. in psychology and B.Mus.A in piano performance from the University of Michigan.

My research examines how people grapple with individual and cultural experiences in an increasingly globalized world. In my first line of research, I study how people think and behave outside their cultural conceptual landscape. I show people experience "hypocognition", when they lack cognitive or linguistic representations of concepts to describe ideas or explicate experiences.

My second line of research examines intercultural perception.
