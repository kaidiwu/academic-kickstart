I am a Ph.D. candidate in social psychology working with David Dunning at the University of Michigan. Prior to graduate school, I received my B.A. in psychology and B.Mus.A in piano performance from the University of Michigan.

My research addresses the challenges to peopleâ€™s understanding of culture and diversity in an increasingly globalized world. I tackle two questions in relation to what fuels social conflict and cultural misunderstanding: 
1) What are the cognitive and social consequences for lacking cultural knowledge? 
2) How do cultures perceive each other in an era of globalization, and how does intercultural perception, in turn, shape consumer behavior and hiring decisions?
